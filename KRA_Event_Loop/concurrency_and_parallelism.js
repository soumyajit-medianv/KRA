// Concurrency and Parallelism

// Concurrency
// Concurrency is when multiple tasks are in progress at the same time, but not necessarily running at the exact same moment.
// In a single-threaded language like JavaScript, concurrency is made possible through asynchronous operations and the event loop.
// Example: When JavaScript sends a request to a server, it doesn’t wait. It moves on and deals with the response later — that's concurrency.
// JS continues execution without waiting — that's concurrency.

// Real life example:
// A single chef takes multiple order. while waiting for rice to boil, they start preparing curry.


// Parallelism
// Parallelism is when multiple tasks are literally running at the same time on multiple CPU cores or threads.
// This requires multi-threading or multi-core processors.

// Real life example:
// Multiple chef cook different dishes at the same time, on differnt gas.
