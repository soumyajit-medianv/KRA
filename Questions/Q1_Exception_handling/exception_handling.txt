In NestJS, exception handling ensures that unexpected behavior (EX - bad input or server error) is caught and managed instead of crashing the application.

Purpose of Exception Handling
For Developers:
Helps to understand where and why an error happened.
Prevents application from crashing unexpectedly.

For End-users/Operators:
Returns user-friendly error messages.
Prevents exposing sensitive internal errors.
